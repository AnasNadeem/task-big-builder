Task 
	Big Builders is a construction and structural engineering company. They have multiple
	subcontractors who perform various tasks for them, e.g.,

	• Ground levelling
	• Cleaning of site rubbish
	• Landscape work

These subcontractors submit a work completion report along with a payment demand. Currently this
requires a site engineer to visit the site or see photographs to verify progress.

Big Builders would like a build a service in which the contractors would be able to submit these
pictures and based on services interpretation of work completion, it would automatically release
payment.

Please provide a high level solution approach to achieve this using Python AI/ML methods which
must be able to run on premise infrastructure.

Key Considerations:

• Users must be authenticated via OAUTH
• If your solution needs a BOT, utilize RASA
• Solution must be portable across environments both on premise and cloud
